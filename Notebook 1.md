# Notebook 1

The aim of this notebook is to create a Hash Table. Click [**here**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k7Ibn6BPcFlu-gecrnWDqppT2C4xCbio?usp=sharing) to access Notebook 1.

## Task 1

The first cell creates a `HashTable` class. Click `Shift` + `Enter` to run this cell.

```python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 0
        self.buckets = []
```

## Task 2

Add an `insert` method to the `HashTable` class.
```python
    def insert(self, key, value):
        if not self.buckets:
            self.buckets = [None] * 16
```
The `insert` method takes an **entry** consisting of a `key` and a `value`. The first line of the method checks if the hash table has any buckets. If it doesn't, the method initializes the array with the capacity to store 16 elements.

## Task 3

Rerun the cell (`Shift` + `Enter`) so that the changes are recognized.

## Task 4
Inside the second cell, create a `HashTable` object.
```python
inventory = HashTable()
```
Add the following entry into the `HashTable`.

```python
inventory = HashTable()
inventory.insert("Banana", 2.99)
```
Run the cell.

## Task 5

Inside the third cell, add code that displays the contents of our HashTable.
```python
def displayInventory():
    for index, item in enumerate(inventory.buckets):
        print("\nBUCKET {0}".format(index))
        print(item)
```
Run the cell
## Task 6

Inside the fourth cell, call `displayInventory()`.
```python
displayInventory()
```

Run every cell by clicking **Runtime** | **Run all**.

Your final output should display a HashTable with 16 buckets.

```
BUCKET 0
None

BUCKET 1
None

BUCKET 2
None

...
```
